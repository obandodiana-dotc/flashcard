🇩🇪 1-Month German A1 Plan (Day-by-Day) ✨A self-contained, gamified web application for mastering German A1 fundamentals in 30 days. A personal project demonstrating pure front-end development and commitment to language learning.🌟 Project OverviewThis is a personal educational project developed to serve as a structured and motivating digital tutor for German A1. The primary goal was to create a comprehensive 30-day learning curriculum that is fully self-contained.The application is built exclusively with HTML, CSS (Tailwind via CDN), and pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS). This design choice highlights the ability to manage complex state and persistent data without relying on any back-end or database. All user progress, streaks, and journal entries are securely saved locally using the browser's localStorage.💡 Personal Motivation & Technical GoalsThis project successfully addresses a dual objective:Linguistic Goal: Provide a clear, step-by-step path to achieve conversational proficiency at the German A1 level.Technical Goal (Portfolio Piece): Showcase strong foundational front-end skills by implementing:State Management: Handling the daily progress, task completion, and long-term streak entirely with Vanilla JavaScript and localStorage.Data Persistence: Developing robust Export/Import functionality to allow users to back up and transfer their progress (as a JSON file).Modular UI: Utilizing JavaScript to dynamically render complex daily lesson content and task lists from a simple data array.Modern Styling: Rapidly building a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface using Tailwind CSS utilities.🎯 Key Educational FeaturesThe application is engineered to promote effective self-study:FeaturePedagogical Benefit30-Day CurriculumBreaks down the German A1 syllabus (greetings, sein/haben, articles, W-Fragen) into manageable daily units.Lesson & Task TabsSeparates theory (Clase del Día) from active application (Práctica y Tareas), ensuring both understanding and practice occur.Practice JournalA dedicated text area for daily writing prompts, crucial for active language production and long-term memory.Gamified MetricsDisplays a Total Progress (%) and a Streak counter to encourage consistency and celebrate learning milestones.Wort des TagesFocuses the learner on a single key vocabulary word daily, complete with plural form and translation.💻 Technologies UsedTechnologyRole in the ProjectHTML5Core application structure and content templates.Vanilla JavaScriptAll business logic, DOM manipulation, and state persistence via localStorage.Tailwind CSS (CDN)Utility-first CSS framework for a responsive, modern, and clean design.Canvas ConfettiProvides positive visual feedback upon task completion.🚀 Installation and UsageThis project is a static web application and requires no complex setup or server.Download: Clone the repository or download the main index.html file.Run: Simply double-click the index.html file.Start Learning: The application will open immediately in any modern web browser.Data Safety: Since all data is stored locally, it is highly recommended to use the Export button in the Journal section regularly to save a backup of your progress (as a JSON file) in case the browser cache is cleared.🤝 ContributionsWhile this project originated as a personal learning initiative, pull requests are welcome for:Improving the clarity or accuracy of the German lesson content.Enhancing the front-end performance or accessibility (A11Y).Adding simple interactive quizzes or grammar exercises.📜 LicenseThis project is distributed under the MIT License.
